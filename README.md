# deap-minimization-function
DEAP (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python) is an evolutionary computation framework for rapid prototyping and testing of ideas. It seeks to make algorithms explicit and data structures transparent. Crossover and mutation are two important concepts here. From a set of initial solutions, known as the heterogeneous "initial population", created randomly in a certain range, so that at each evolutionary stage a more homogeneous population is reached, with the best solutions found (close to the global optimum)  In the example, the function has a global minimum -34, reached when x=10 and y=8
